         * Look for a temporary variable that is assigned to once.
             ? If a temp is set more than once consider Split Temporary Variable.
        ·  Declare the temp as final.
        ·  Compile.
             ? This will ensure that the temp is only assigned to once.  
        ·  Extract the right -hand side of the assignment into a method.
              ? Initially mark the method as private. You may find more use for it late r, 
        but you can easily relax the protection later.  
              ? Ensure the extracted method is free of side effects, that is, it does not 
        modify any object. If it is not free of side effects, use Separate Query  from Modifier . 
        ·  Compile and test.
        ·  Use Replace Temp with Queryon the temp.
